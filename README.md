# VendettaThemes

Some cool themes originally made by @ArisonID

Honestly though, his repository could do with a lot of work (and less retardism), so here we are!

## How to Use
- Visit any theme of your choice
- Click on RAW
- Copy raw link from browser address bar
- Open Vendetta -> Themes -> "+ icon" -> Paste raw link
- Theme should be imported inside vendetta!
